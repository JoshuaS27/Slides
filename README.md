# Purpose

My first attempt at building a website from scratch. I am using this as an opportunity to expand my knowledge of full stack web development and increasing my toolset as well as refamiliarizing myself with some forgotten and unused concepts.

If this all goes well I will also be able to gift this website to a friend so that they can opperate a small business.

# Tech Stack
I intend on using some tools that I know as well as some that are new and others that I haven't used in years. It may not be the most sound stack to some, but I have my reasons why I chose certain things that may not make sense to all. 

Additionally some of the choices I made are based on cursory searches that I found on the web as well as input from generative AI's such as gemini and chatGPT.

To anyone who sees this, I am open to input as I know I don't have all the answers. So please feel free to leave me a comment.
